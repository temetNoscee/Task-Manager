    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Hello! We, Eda and GÃ¶zde, are excited to share a new project we've prepared as web design students. 
        We've developed an application named Task Manager and enjoyed the pleasure of working together throughout this process. 
        Task Manager offers a simple and user-friendly interface designed to easily manage tasks. 
        It provides a practical platform to track, prioritize, and complete each task. Our aim is to focus on users' needs, 
        aiming to make them more efficient and organized. We would be delighted to receive your feedback by examining our project.
        With your support, we aim to grow and learn together, aspiring to undertake even more creative projects in the future!
    </p>
